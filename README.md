# ML Model
This repository includes code for creating frames from the WESAD dataset, preprocessing of the frames, training of the ML model, and evaluation of the model.

### Data Handling
To create frames for training, testing, and validation, use the `wesad_data_handling.py` script. To use the script, the path to the WESAD dataset must be provided as well as the name of the desired data types, the sampling frequencies of these, and the desired window size in second for each data type.
